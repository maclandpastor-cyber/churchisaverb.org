# Church Is a Verb

This repository hosts the public website for **churchisaverb.org**.

The site exists for one simple purpose:
to provide free access to the *Holy Shifts* manuscript and to point readers toward a way of understanding church as something we **practice**, not something we **own**.

There is no product being sold here.
There are no ads.
There is no data being collected.

Just a door. And an invitation.

## Final note

If you’re reading this and wondering why it’s so simple,
that’s the point.

Church doesn’t need more infrastructure.
It needs more movement.
